This code reads in the terms and conditions from a file named "terms_and_conditions.txt" and tokenizes the text into sentences and words. 
It then removes stop words and punctuation, lemmatizes the remaining words, and extracts key phrases using the NLTK library's named entity recognition (NER) functionality. 
Finally, it prints out the key phrases in bulletins.
